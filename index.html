                            <p>It's Christmas 1990. There's this huge, clunky alien object, which seems to have invaded - at least to the three year old me - the entire house. It's surrounded by wires, and it speaks a foreign language that everyone pretends to understand but no-one really does, except for my Dad. There are thick manuals sprawled around it with obscure names such as C and Perl. Yet we're captivated by its presence. And we know that life will never be the same.</p>

                            <p>Fast forward puberty, iPods and many beards later, and it’s not computers but the world of Design I find myself in. Having taken an initial interest in Maths and Physics - Design was just one of those things I fell into. I enjoyed staring at a blank canvas and figuring out how to fill it. I learnt to show less and say more. As time went by, I learnt how to solve a problem. To design a solution. This had a lasting impact on me. Design is everywhere and happens whether we mean it or not. I eventually dropped out and wandered into something else. But this story of design had not finished.</p>

                            <p>I began dancing after hearing about a friend of a friend who was teaching. I joined their group and for the next year you could find us training most days at a local boxing gym. Of course we weren’t very good. Around the time YouTube had launched. It changed everything. For the first time, you didn’t need to go to another country to see the best dancers. It was huge! A group from LA were gaining a following online, and sensing an opportunity we reached out to one of their members. We offered an all expenses trip to London with a series of workshops we were arranging. Of course we didn’t have any workshops scheduled, nor had we ever arranged any. They agreed and flew over. We managed to get a few classes together, and everything worked out ok. But crucially we learnt in a few weeks of hanging out with them, what it would have taken us years to learn on our own. With our newly found skills we toured the country, did a few commercials and even supported Usher at his o2 OMG tour, name drop!</p>

                            <p>In search of work that would help me get by; I started my own business; a dance school. What started as a small class with 30 children quickly grew to a network of over a 5,000 children spanning four boroughs. Mistakes were never far away, but the passion that flourished within me, proved to be the catalyst for organic growth. I employed a team of industry dancers and together we partnered with schools across London. We sold out fringe theatres, liaised with London councils, and harassed heads of education for change. We stuck by it for 5 years.</p>

                            <div class="line"></div>
                            <p>During my time in education, a big problem became too large to ignore. Although dance was mandatory in schools, teachers didn't have the technical know how to teach dance. I set out to solve this problem with a bootstrapped education startup. Those three words don’t sit well together – tough times ahead. Together with my technical cofounder, we created a native iOS application that teachers could use to deliver a dance class, quickly, easily and with little fuss – regardless of experience. Think cookbook for dance. I was focused on product and growth; testing, iterating, pitching and plugging. We nailed the problem, but education is notoriously difficult particularly when trying to change things that have remained unchanged for...well forever. We were met with apprehension and lots of closed doors. But we persisted, a few schools at a time, and eventually landed a sizeable deal with a channel partner for 100+ schools. Two weeks until launch and I woke up to a resignation email from my co-founder. He didn’t have a passion for dance or education. I did. He had the technical understanding, and I didn’t. But I had learnt to persist. My passion outweighed any excuse. I didn’t have any of the cool tech, but I was solving a real problem. I managed to complete a deal with our channel partner to sell the content for their team to use. Although it was far from ideal, it was a reward for the time I invested - but not the end.d.</p>

                            <p>Selling the product I had previously built, allowed me to spend the last 12 months learning how to code. What I learnt here was not just how to build things, or even the mechanics behind programming. I learnt how to learn. It redefined what understanding something means to me. What information can I use to find the solution? How can I quickly identify the best source for that information. Sometimes a wolf in sheep’s clothing can be the biggest deterrent. I have attended regular meetups related to web development and startups to keep in touch with peers and often to pair program. The number of frameworks, libraries and languages seem to increase daily. So deciding to study for a Mathematics BSc seemed an easy choice. If there’s one thing thats not going anywhere, its Maths.</p>

I am hungry to learn as much as possible and with my bullish stubbornness - I will endeavour to make it a reality.</p>
