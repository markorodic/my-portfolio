                            <p>It's Christmas 1990. There's this huge, clunky alien object, which seems to have invaded - at least to the three year old me - the entire house. It's surrounded by wires, and it speaks a foreign language that everyone pretends to understand but no-one really does, except for my Dad. There are thick manuals sprawled around it with obscure names such as C and Perl. Yet we're captivated by its presence. And we know that life will never be the same.</p>

                            <p>In search of work that would afford me the time to look after my mum while covering all of our expenses; I started my own business; a dance school. What started as a small class with 30 children quickly grew to a network of over a 5,000 children spanning four boroughs. Mistakes were never far away, but the passion that flourished within me, proved to be the catalyst for organic growth. I employed a team of industry dancers and together we partnered with schools across London. We sold out fringe theatres, liaised with London councils, and harassed heads of education for change. We stuck by it for 5 years before a big problem became too large to ignore.</p>

                            <div class="line"></div>
                            <p>I set out to solve this problem with a bootstrapped education startup. Those three words don’t sit well together – tough times ahead. Together with my technical cofounder, we created a native iOS application that teachers could use to deliver a dance class, quickly, easily and with little fuss – regardless of experience. Think cookbook for dance. I was focused on product and growth; testing, iterating, pitching and plugging. We nailed the problem, but education is notoriously difficult particularly when trying to change things that have remained unchanged for...well forever. We were met with apprehension and lots of closed doors. But we persisted, a few schools at a time, and eventually landed a sizeable deal with a channel partner for 100+ schools. Two weeks until launch and I woke up to a resignation email from my cofounder. He didn’t have a passion for dance or education. I did. He had the technical understanding, and I didn’t. But I had learnt to persist. My passion outweighed any excuse. I didn’t have any of the cool tech, but I was solving a real problem. I managed to complete a deal with our channel partner to sell the content for their team to use. Although it was far from ideal, it was a reward for the time I invested - but not the end.</p>

                            <p>Selling the product allowed me to spend the last 12 months learning how to code. What I learnt here was not just how to build things, or even the mechanics behind programming. I learnt how to learn. It redefined what understanding something means to me. What information can I use to find the solution? How can I quickly identify the best source for that information. Sometimes a wolf in sheep’s clothing can be the biggest deterrent. I have attended regular meetups related to web development and startups to keep in touch with peers and often to pair program. The number of frameworks, libraries and languages seem to increase daily. That’s why I decided to also study for a Mathematics BSc, which I feel underpins all software. If there’s one thing thats not going anywhere, its Maths! Next month I am also hoping to take part in the first cohort of the YC Startup School MOOC to learn more about startups from a network of experts in that space.</p>
